Ideal folder structure


/app: The main directory for the application.

/templates: Contains the HTML templates for your application.
/static: Stores static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
/main: Contains the main routes and views for your application.
/auth: Dedicated to authentication (login, registration, logout).
/api: If your application provides an API, you define your API routes here.
/models: Contains SQLAlchemy models for your database schema.
/services: For business logic that is abstracted away from the route logic.
init.py: Initializes your Flask application and brings together other components.
/migrations: Stores database migration scripts (useful if you're using Flask-Migrate).

/tests: Contains unit and integration tests for your application.

/venv: Virtual environment directory to isolate your Python/Django dependencies.

config.py: Configuration settings for your Flask application, such as database details.

run.py: The entry point to run your Flask application.

requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies for your project, which can be installed with pip install -r requirements.txt.

.env: Stores environment-specific variables in a secure manner (e.g., database credentials).

.gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore (e.g., /venv, .env).
